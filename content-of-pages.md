# XiomTech competitive pricing blueprint for Bangladesh and the Gulf

**XiomTech can profitably undercut every major Bangladeshi SaaS competitor by 15–25% while maintaining gross margins above 80%.** The math works because infrastructure costs for a lean SaaS startup run just **$60–190/month** total, while even the cheapest competitor charges ৳1,000/month ($8.30) per customer. With 50 paying customers across all products, XiomTech would cover all infrastructure costs and begin generating profit. The Bangladesh SaaS market is growing at **25.4% CAGR**, and a dual-pricing strategy — affordable BDT tiers for Bangladesh, premium USD/SAR pricing for UAE and Saudi Arabia at 3–5× the Bangladesh rate — creates an enormous arbitrage opportunity that few local companies are exploiting.

## The Bangladesh SaaS pricing landscape, product by product

### XiomPOS: Cloud POS + ecommerce

The POS market in Bangladesh is the most competitive of XiomTech's target categories, with at least a dozen active players. The pricing floor sits at **৳880–1,000/month** for basic plans, and the sweet spot for Bangladeshi SMEs is **৳1,000–2,500/month**. Here is what the key competitors actually charge:

| Competitor | Entry Tier | Mid Tier | Top Tier | Setup Fee | Pricing Model |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|----------|---------------|
| **AmarSolution** | ৳1,000/mo (3 users, 1K products) | ৳2,000/mo (5 users, 4K products) | ৳3,000/mo (10 users, unlimited) | ৳10,000–20,000 | Per-tier + add-ons |
| **Ehishab** | ৳1,000/mo (Silver) | ৳1,500/mo (Gold) | ৳3,000–5,000/mo (Platinum/Custom) | Not disclosed | Flat monthly |
| **Mediasoft** | ~৳3,000–10,000/mo | Custom | Custom | Custom | Per-outlet, quote-based |
| **DokanE** | Not published | Not published | Not published | Not published | Per-location (unlimited users/items) |
| **NexPOS** | ৳880/mo or ৳8,800/yr | — | — | — | Flat subscription |
| **Managerium (AKIJ iBOS)** | ৳1,000/mo per outlet | ৳3,000/mo | ৳5,000/mo | ৳30,000–100,000 | Per-outlet + setup |

Additional context: SK POS charges ৳1,000/month at entry level, Financfy (accounting+POS hybrid) starts at ৳1,800/month, and one-time license POS products range from ৳12,000–50,000. A **15% VAT** applies on top of all published prices.

**Recommended XiomPOS pricing:**

| Tier | Monthly Price | Key Limits | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Free** | ৳0 | 1 user, 100 products, 1 outlet, basic reports | Acquisition funnel; beats every competitor's entry |
| **Starter** | ৳799/mo | 3 users, 1,000 products, 1 outlet, ecommerce store | Undercuts AmarSolution Basic (৳1,000) by 20% |
| **Growth** | ৳1,499/mo | 5 users, unlimited products, 2 outlets | Slots between AmarSolution Standard and Ehishab Gold |
| **Pro** | ৳2,499/mo | 15 users, unlimited everything, priority support | Undercuts Ehishab Platinum (৳3,000) and AmarSolution Premium |
| **Setup fee** | ৳5,000 (waived on annual plans) | — | Undercuts ৳10,000–20,000 industry standard |

Annual discount: **20% off** (industry norm is 15–17%). This makes Starter effectively ৳639/month annually — extremely competitive.

### XiomHR: HR and payroll management

Bangladesh HR software pricing varies widely depending on whether vendors charge flat rates or per-employee. The key data points:

| Competitor | Pricing Model | Entry Price | Mid Price | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|------------|----------|-------|
| **PiHR** | Flat tiers by headcount | ৳2,500/mo (1–25 employees) | ৳4,000/mo (26–50) | 6-month advance required for smallest tier |
| **AccordHRM** | Per-employee | ৳80/employee/mo (Essential) | ৳100–150/employee/mo | No upfront costs; ISO-certified |
| **PeopleDesk** | Custom quotes | Estimated ৳5,000–15,000/mo | Premium positioning | Targets medium-large enterprises |
| **Smart HRM** | Flat tiers | ৳1,200/mo (10–15 employees, SME) | ৳3,000–5,500/mo (standard) | Free installation on SME packages |
| **Tipsoi** | Modular | ৳1,000/mo starting | — | 7-day trial |

For a 50-employee company, monthly costs range from **৳2,400 (Smart HRM)** to **৳7,500 (AccordHRM Premium)**. International tools like Zoho People would cost ~৳12,000/month and BambooHR an eye-watering ৳60,000–90,000/month for the same headcount.

**Recommended XiomHR pricing:**

| Tier | Monthly Price | Employee Limit | Rationale |
|------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Free** | ৳0 | Up to 10 employees, basic HR + attendance | Captures micro-businesses no competitor serves free |
| **Starter** | ৳999/mo | Up to 25 employees, payroll + leave management | Undercuts PiHR (৳2,500) and Smart HRM SME (৳1,200) |
| **Business** | ৳2,499/mo | Up to 100 employees, full HRMS + compliance | Beats PiHR's ৳6,000 tier and AccordHRM's ৳5,000–10,000 range |
| **Enterprise** | ৳4,999/mo | Unlimited employees | Undercuts PeopleDesk and Jibika Plexus |

The per-employee model (AccordHRM style) scales poorly for the customer and creates sticker shock at 100+ employees. **XiomHR's flat-tier model is more attractive** and easier to sell.

### XiomAccounts: Cloud accounting

Local cloud accounting ranges from **৳1,800/month** (Extreme OFFICE) to **৳9,000/month** (Financfy Advanced). The desktop incumbent Tally Prime commands ৳37,000–120,000 as a one-time license. International options like Zoho Books start at $15/month (~৳1,800) but go up to $240/month.

**Recommended XiomAccounts pricing:**

| Tier | Monthly Price | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Free** | ৳0 (basic invoicing, 50 transactions/mo) | Compete with Wave (free) and Zoho Books Free |
| **Starter** | ৳999/mo | Undercut Extreme OFFICE (৳1,800) and Zoho Books Standard |
| **Professional** | ৳2,499/mo | Compete with Financfy Mini (৳4,500) at nearly half the price |
| **Business** | ৳4,999/mo | Compete with Financfy Mid (৳6,300) with more value |

Bangladesh-specific compliance features — **NBR VAT returns, mushak forms, and BDT-formatted reports** — are essential differentiators against international tools.

### XiomEdu: Education management

School management software in Bangladesh typically costs **৳10,000–50,000/year** for cloud solutions or ৳30,000–50,000+ as one-time purchases. Most vendors provide custom quotes rather than transparent pricing. Edufy charges ৳10,000–50,000/year depending on school size, BDStall offers a ৳30,000 one-time package, and Acquaint's "Shikkha" starts at ৳50,000 as a base price.

**Recommended XiomEdu pricing:**

| Tier | Annual Price | Target |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Free** | ৳0 (up to 50 students, basic features) | Coaching centers, tutors |
| **School** | ৳8,000/year (৳699/mo) | Small schools up to 300 students |
| **Institution** | ৳24,000/year (৳1,999/mo) | Colleges, large schools up to 2,000 students |
| **Enterprise** | ৳48,000/year (৳3,999/mo) | University departments, school chains |

This undercuts Edufy's ৳10,000 minimum and BDStall's ৳30,000 one-time cost while offering a modern cloud experience with parent/student portals and mobile apps.

### XiomTickets: Customer support ticketing

This category is **dominated by international players** with virtually no local Bangladeshi competition. Freshdesk charges $15/agent/month for its Growth plan, Zoho Desk starts at $7/agent/month, and Zendesk begins at $19/agent/month. The only local player found (PrismSTS) serves banking exclusively with custom enterprise pricing.

**Recommended XiomTickets pricing:**

| Tier | Monthly Price | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Free** | ৳0 (2 agents, basic email ticketing) | Match Freshdesk Free |
| **Team** | ৳499/agent/mo (~$4.15) | Undercut Zoho Desk Express ($7) by 40% |
| **Pro** | ৳999/agent/mo (~$8.30) | Undercut Freshdesk Growth ($15) by 45% |
| **Business** | ৳1,999/agent/mo (~$16.60) | Compete with Freshdesk Pro ($49) at 66% less |

The massive pricing gap between international tools and what Bangladeshi businesses can afford represents **XiomTech's strongest market opportunity**. A Bangla-language, bKash-integrated ticketing system at ৳499/agent is genuinely novel.

### XiomCare: Healthcare management

Healthcare software pricing in Bangladesh varies enormously: from ৳700 (basic diagnostic tool) to ৳500,000+ (full hospital ERP). Cloud subscriptions for small hospitals start at **৳4,000/month** (Zaman IT). Clintee offers a freemium model for clinics.

**Recommended XiomCare pricing:**

| Tier | Monthly Price | Target |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Free** | ৳0 (single doctor, basic appointments + patient records) | Solo practitioners |
| **Clinic** | ৳1,999/mo | Small clinics, up to 5 doctors |
| **Hospital** | ৳4,999/mo | Small hospitals, up to 50 beds |
| **Enterprise** | ৳9,999/mo | Medium hospitals, multi-department |

This positions below Zaman IT's ৳4,000/month entry while offering a free tier that no local competitor provides.

## Infrastructure costs make these margins work

The single most important number for XiomTech's pricing strategy is the infrastructure cost floor. A bootstrapped SaaS startup in 2026 can operate on remarkably little:

**Monthly infrastructure for a growing SaaS (~5,000 users):**

| Component | Cost | Best Option |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Hosting (Vercel Pro, 2 seats) | $40–100 | Vercel Pro at $20/seat |
| Database (Supabase or Neon) | $19–25 | Supabase Pro at $25/mo includes auth + storage |
| Email (Resend or SendGrid) | $0–20 | Free tier covers 3,000 emails/mo; Pro at $20 for 50K |
| Domain (.com + .com.bd) | ~$2/mo | Cloudflare at $10.44/year; .com.bd at ~৳1,280/2 years |
| SSL | $0 | Let's Encrypt or Cloudflare — free and fully sufficient |
| CDN | $0 | Cloudflare Free tier — unlimited bandwidth |
| Monitoring | $0–25 | Sentry Free (5K errors), Uptime Robot Free (50 monitors) |
| **Total** | **$60–190/mo** | **৳7,200–22,800/mo** |

At 50,000 users, costs scale to roughly **$270–1,025/month**. Payment gateway fees (SSLCommerz at 2.5% or bKash merchant at 1.5–1.85%) are per-transaction and come out of revenue, not fixed costs.

**One-time setup costs:** SSLCommerz integration runs ৳15,000–25,500, and AamarPay is cheaper at ৳4,999–15,999. Domain registration totals ~$20 across .com and .com.bd.

The gross margin calculation is straightforward. If XiomPOS Starter generates ৳799/month per customer and the per-customer infrastructure cost is roughly ৳50–150 (at scale with hundreds of customers), **gross margins exceed 80%**. For a developer-founder with no office costs, net margins of **40–60%** are achievable once past the breakeven point of approximately 30–50 paying customers.

## The UAE and Saudi Arabia pricing multiplier

The Gulf market represents XiomTech's highest-margin opportunity. **Identical SaaS products sell for 3–5× more in the Middle East** than in Bangladesh:

- POS software in UAE: **AED 100–700/month ($27–191)** vs. ৳1,000–3,000/month ($8–25) in BD
- HR software in KSA: **$3–8/employee/month** via Bayzat, ZenHR, PeopleHum vs. ৳80–150/employee ($0.67–1.25) in BD
- Accounting in Saudi: **SAR 69–799/month ($18–213)** via Zoho Books, Qoyod vs. ৳1,800–9,000/month ($15–75) in BD

The GCC HR technology market alone is worth **$2.5 billion (2023)** heading to **$5.5 billion by 2032**. A Bangladesh-based company selling at the lower end of Gulf pricing — say $30–50/month for POS, $3–5/employee for HR — would still earn **4–6× what the same product generates domestically** while undercutting regional players like Foodics (SAR 800–3,000/month) and Bayzat.

**Critical requirements for Gulf expansion:** Arabic language support, ZATCA e-invoicing compliance for Saudi Arabia, WPS (Wage Protection System) and GOSI integration for HR products, and acceptance of local payment methods. Without these, no amount of price advantage matters.

**Recommended Gulf pricing (separate from BD tiers):**

| Product | Entry Tier (USD) | Mid Tier (USD) | Positioning |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| XiomPOS | $29/mo | $79/mo | Undercut Syrve ($68), Slant ($39) |
| XiomHR | $2/employee/mo | $5/employee/mo | Match PeopleHum, undercut ZenHR |
| XiomAccounts | $19/mo | $49/mo | Undercut Zoho Books, match Qoyod |

## Freemium design that converts in price-sensitive markets

Global freemium-to-paid conversion averages **2–5%**, with top performers reaching 6–10%. In a price-sensitive market like Bangladesh, XiomTech should expect closer to **2–3%** initially. The math still works: if 1,000 free users convert at 3%, that yields 30 paying customers at an average of ৳1,500/month = ৳45,000/month recurring revenue.

The optimal free tier follows the **80/20 rule** — offer 80% of core functionality free, but gate the 20% of features that power users need most. Effective upgrade triggers include storage limits, user/employee caps, number of transactions, advanced reporting, and multi-branch support. Slack's model of limiting message history and Canva's gating of premium templates both demonstrate this principle at scale.

**Localized pricing boosts conversion by approximately 31%** according to ProfitWell data. XiomTech should price exclusively in BDT for Bangladesh (never showing USD equivalents) and accept bKash/Nagad payments, which increases conversion by up to **30%** in markets with low credit card penetration.

Free trials with no credit card required convert at **18–25%** — significantly higher than pure freemium. XiomTech should combine both: a permanent free tier for acquisition plus a **14-day free trial of Pro features** that requires no payment method upfront.

---

## Custom development as a revenue bridge

While SaaS revenue scales, custom software development provides immediate cash flow. Bangladesh developer rates for client-facing work run **$10–40/hour**, with the market segmented clearly:

- **Junior developers:** $10–15/hour
- **Mid-level:** $15–25/hour  
- **Senior/full-stack:** $25–40/hour

Project-based pricing for common deliverables: a basic web application (MVP) costs **$25,000–50,000**, a mobile app runs **$15,000–40,000**, and complex ERP systems command **$100,000–200,000+**. Major firms like Brain Station 23 (850+ employees) and Cefalo serve US/EU clients at these rates, while smaller shops charge less.

XiomTech, as a lean operation, could charge **$15–25/hour** or offer fixed-price packages: a basic business website at ৳50,000–100,000, a custom web application at ৳200,000–500,000, and mobile apps at ৳150,000–400,000. This generates revenue immediately while building the portfolio that attracts SaaS customers.

## Conclusion: the pricing strategy in three moves

XiomTech's optimal path combines three interlocking strategies. **First**, launch all six products with generous free tiers that no Bangladeshi competitor offers — this is the single biggest differentiator in a market where the cheapest plans start at ৳880–1,000/month. **Second**, price paid tiers 15–25% below the nearest competitor in each category while maintaining flat, transparent pricing (not custom quotes or per-employee models that create uncertainty). The target average revenue per paying customer should be **৳1,000–2,500/month** for Bangladesh, yielding gross margins above 80% against infrastructure costs of ৳50–150 per customer at scale. **Third**, build Gulf-market versions of the top 2–3 products with Arabic localization and regulatory compliance, pricing at 3–5× the Bangladesh rate. Even 20 paying customers in Saudi Arabia at $50/month would equal the revenue from 120 Bangladeshi customers at ৳1,500/month. The infrastructure to serve both markets is identical — only the pricing page changes.
