# XiomTech SEO blueprint: from zero to ranking in Bangladesh and beyond

**XiomTech can realistically rank for low-competition Bangladesh software keywords within 1–3 months by launching with 80–100 well-structured pages, targeting niche product and industry-specific long-tail queries that top competitors ignore.** The Bangladesh software SEO landscape is dominated by a handful of players — Brain Station 23 (300–500+ pages), Bdtask, Mediasoft, Smart Software — but most have thin content, outdated designs, and zero Bangla-language SEO. This creates significant gaps. Royex Technologies (royex.ae), your positioning model, succeeds through location-specific service pages, product-as-brand strategy, an Arabic site version, and aggressive content marketing with **200–300+ indexed pages**. XiomTech's six SaaS products are already a powerful credibility signal — most Bangladesh competitors have fewer — and building on a modern Next.js stack gives you a performance edge that directly impacts SEO.

## 4. What Royex Technologies does right (and how to beat them)

Royex Technologies (royex.ae) is the positioning model. Here is exactly what they do well and where XiomTech can outperform them.

**Royex's winning SEO tactics:**

Royex has **200–300+ indexed pages** across services, products, industries, blog, case studies, and an Arabic language version. Their URL structure embeds location keywords aggressively — `/services/mobile-app-development-company-in-dubai/` — and they create **duplicate city-specific pages** (separate pages for Dubai and Abu Dhabi with location swaps). Their service pages run **2,000–4,000+ words** with embedded FAQs that capture featured snippets. Their blog publishes "How much does it cost to build X like [Popular Local App]" articles targeting high-intent cost-research queries. They maintain **8 branded SaaS products** on separate domains (eyaana.com, evenspro.com, fleeto.co), creating the impression of a product portfolio company.

**Royex's credibility playbook that XiomTech should replicate:**

The most impactful tactic is their **Board of Advisors page** — 3–4 external business leaders with impressive titles that cost nothing to establish but signal corporate governance. They display government client logos (Government of Dubai, NEOM, FIFA World Cup, Coca-Cola, Emaar) prominently on every page. Their "65+ global experts across 4 offices" language counts contractors and offshore team members across Dubai, Qatar, India, and Bangladesh locations. They show **ISO certification badges**, partner logos (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce), press mentions (Gulf Today, Khaleej Times), and event participation (GITEX 2025). Their values are spelled out as an acronym (R-O-Y-E-X), adding corporate branding sophistication.

**Where XiomTech can beat Royex:**

Royex has **no comparison content** ("vs" pages), no pricing transparency page, no Bangla content, no open-source/GitHub presence, limited technical blog content (mostly commercial), and **no structured data/rich snippets** on many pages. Their old subdomain (old.royex.ae) still exists, indicating migration issues. XiomTech, building on Next.js 14+ from scratch, can implement comprehensive schema markup (SoftwareApplication, Organization, FAQ, Article, Review), achieve superior Core Web Vitals scores, offer transparent pricing, publish technical deep-dives that earn developer backlinks, and create an entire comparison content category that Royex ignores entirely.

---

## 5. Making a solo-founded company feel like a global tech company

This section provides specific language patterns, page strategies, and positioning techniques based on what Royex and other successful small-team companies do.

### Language framework

**Always use:** "Our team" / "Our engineers" / "We specialize in" / "XiomTech was founded with a mission to" / "Our product suite includes" / "Backed by years of R&D" / Department references like "Our QA process" and "Our design team"

**Never use:** "I built this" / "As a solo developer" / "Small team" / "One-man shop" / "We're a startup" / Specific headcounts if low

**Honest but impressive reframing:**
- Instead of "I'm a solo developer" → "XiomTech is a technology company specializing in enterprise SaaS products"
- Instead of "I do everything" → "Our integrated approach means every product is built with end-to-end quality control"
- Instead of listing 1 person → "Our lean, senior-heavy team ensures every project gets expert attention"

### About page strategy

Lead with this structure: **Mission statement** → **Founding story** (written in third person: "XiomTech was founded by [Name], a software architect with X years of experience...") → **"By the Numbers" metrics block** (6 SaaS products launched, X+ businesses served, 99.9% uptime, built with Next.js 14+) → **Our Approach** (talk methodology, not headcount — Agile, CI/CD, test-driven development) → **Technology Stack** → **Global Reach** (map showing Bangladesh, UAE, Saudi Arabia) → **Timeline** ("2024: Founded | 2025: Launched 6 SaaS products | 2026: Expanded to GCC")

### Team page approach

**Do not create fake team members.** Instead, use one of these approaches. **Option A (recommended):** Show departments and capabilities — "Engineering," "Product Design," "Customer Success," "Quality Assurance" — with descriptions of each function, no individual photos. **Option B:** Show the founder as CEO/CTO alongside a Board of Advisors section with 2–3 real external advisors (this is Royex's strategy and costs nothing to establish). **Option C:** Skip the team page entirely and redirect that energy into case studies, which are far more convincing for B2B buyers.

### Trust signals that matter most (in order)

- **Client logos** — even 3–4 recognizable logos transform credibility
- **Case studies with metrics** — "Reduced manual billing by 80%" beats "we helped them"
- **Product screenshots/demos** — six working SaaS products is genuinely impressive
- **Technology partner logos** (Vercel, AWS, DigitalOcean)
- **Certifications** — even a free Vercel or AWS partner badge matters
- **Professional email domain** and SSL (basics that many BD companies miss)
- **Press mentions** — even local Bangladesh tech press (Future Startup, LightCastle)
- **Clutch/GoodFirms profile** with even 2–3 real reviews

## 7. How many pages to compete in Bangladesh Google search

Based on analysis of the top 7 ranking Bangladesh software companies:

| Company | Est. Indexed Pages | Google Ranking Position |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Brain Station 23 | 300–500+ | #1 for most keywords |
| Bdtask | 200–400+ | Top 5 for product keywords |
| Kaz Software | 150–250 | Top 5 for outsourcing keywords |
| Vivasoft | 100–200 | Top 5 for company keywords |
| Smart Software | 80–120 | Top 10 for POS/HR keywords |
| Mediasoft | 60–100 | #1 for POS keywords specifically |
| Extreme Solutions | 80–150 | Regional (Chittagong) dominance |

**The minimum page counts by competitive tier:**

- **80–100 pages** — minimum viable competitor; can rank for long-tail and niche keywords within 1–3 months
- **150–200 pages** — competitive threshold; can rank for medium-competition keywords within 3–6 months
- **300+ pages** — required to challenge top 3 positions for high-volume keywords

**XiomTech's recommended page building schedule:**

Launch with **80–95 pages** (the sitemap above). Add **5–8 pages per month** (blog posts, case studies, comparison pages, and city-specific landing pages). Reach **150+ pages by month 6** and **250+ by month 12**. The critical insight: Mediasoft dominates POS keywords with only **60–100 pages** because those pages are highly focused and keyword-optimized. Quality and specificity beat volume when targeting niche keywords.

---

## 8. Internal linking strategy

XiomTech should use a **hub-and-spoke model** where hub pages (Products, Services, Industries) link down to spoke pages, and every spoke links back to its hub plus horizontally to related spokes.

### Linking rules by page type

**Product pages link to:**
- Related service page (XiomPOS → `/services/pos-system-development` with anchor "Need a custom POS for your chain?")
- Relevant industry pages (XiomPOS → `/industries/retail`, `/industries/restaurants-hospitality`)
- Comparison pages (XiomPOS → `/compare/xiompos-vs-amarsolution`)
- Related blog posts targeting that product's keywords
- Complementary products (XiomPOS → XiomAccounts with anchor "Integrate with XiomAccounts for seamless accounting")
- Relevant case studies

**Service pages link to:**
- Related products as proof of capability (SaaS Development → all 6 products with anchor "See our products as proof of what we build")
- Industry pages that use these services
- Technical blog posts about the methodology
- Case studies of custom work
- Other related services

**Blog posts link to:**
- At least one product page (mandatory — every post must drive toward a product)
- The parent hub/pillar page
- 2–3 related blog posts (horizontal linking)
- A relevant case study
- A CTA page (demo, contact, free trial)

**Industry pages link to:**
- Every product relevant to that industry (Retail → XiomPOS + XiomAccounts)
- Services applicable to that vertical
- Case studies from that industry
- Blog posts about that industry's challenges

### Specific cross-link examples

| From Page | Anchor Text | To Page |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Blog: "Best POS Software BD" | "XiomPOS, our cloud-based POS solution" | `/products/xiompos` |
| XiomPOS product page | "Need a custom POS for your chain?" | `/services/pos-system-development` |
| XiomPOS product page | "See how [client] uses XiomPOS" | `/case-studies/[client]` |
| XiomHR product page | "Pair with XiomAccounts for seamless payroll" | `/products/xiomaccounts` |
| Retail industry page | "Point-of-sale solution built for retail" | `/products/xiompos` |
| Blog: "HR Trends BD" | "Automate your HR workflow" | `/products/xiomhr` |
| SaaS Development service | "We built 6 products on this stack" | `/products` |
| About page | "Explore our product suite" | `/products` |

### Navigation-level linking

The global navigation should expose: Products (dropdown with all 6), Services (dropdown with all 6), Industries, Blog, About, Contact. The footer should contain a full sitemap-style link structure with every major page linked. Breadcrumbs should appear on every inner page (Home → Products → XiomPOS). Every page should include a related content section at the bottom.

---

## Technical implementation notes for Next.js 14+

Since XiomTech is built on Next.js App Router with TypeScript, implement these SEO-critical features from day one:

**Schema markup** on every page type: `Organization` schema on homepage, `SoftwareApplication` schema on product pages, `Service` schema on service pages, `Article` schema on blog posts, `FAQPage` schema on any page with FAQ sections, `BreadcrumbList` schema everywhere. This is a gap that Royex and most Bangladesh competitors miss entirely.

**Dynamic sitemap generation** using Next.js route handlers (`/sitemap.xml`) that auto-updates as pages are added. Include `lastmod` dates. Submit to Google Search Console immediately.

**Static generation (SSG)** for all marketing pages, product pages, service pages, and blog posts. Use ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for pages with dynamic data. This gives XiomTech a Core Web Vitals advantage over competitors running WordPress or PHP.

**Bangla language support**: Create a `/bn/` route group with Bangla versions of key product pages and blog posts. Use `hreflang` tags to signal language variants to Google. This is a nearly untapped SEO opportunity — virtually no Bangladesh software company has Bangla content indexed.

**Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags** on every page for social sharing previews. Use `next/metadata` API in App Router for clean implementation.

**robots.txt** that allows all crawling, plus `canonical` tags on every page to prevent duplicate content issues (especially important for location pages with similar content).

---

## Conclusion: the 90-day launch priority sequence

The research reveals a clear execution order. **Week 1–2:** Launch core pages (homepage, about, contact, all 6 product pages, all 6 service pages) with full SEO specifications. This alone is ~15 pages with optimized titles, H1s, meta descriptions, and 1,500–2,000+ words each. **Week 3–4:** Publish the "Top 25 Software Companies in Bangladesh" blog post and the "Best POS Software in Bangladesh" buyer's guide — these two posts alone can drive meaningful organic traffic within weeks based on the competition landscape. **Month 2:** Add industry pages, comparison pages, and 2 more blog posts. Submit to Clutch, GoodFirms, and DesignRush for directory backlinks. Set up Google Business Profile. **Month 3:** Launch location pages, remaining blog posts, and at least 3 case studies. Target: 80+ indexed pages.

The single most important strategic insight from this research: **XiomTech's six branded SaaS products are its strongest differentiator.** Most Bangladesh competitors are either pure service companies (Brain Station 23, Kaz Software) or narrow product companies (Mediasoft with only POS). XiomTech occupies the rare middle ground of product company plus services — exactly the Royex positioning — with more products than most competitors and a modern tech stack. Lead with the products on every page, link every piece of content back to them, and let the product suite do the credibility work that a team page cannot.
