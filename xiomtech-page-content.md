## H1: Building enterprise software from Bangladesh for the world

XiomTech is a software company headquartered in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We build SaaS products used by businesses across South Asia and the Middle East, and we deliver custom software development for clients worldwide.

We were founded with one conviction: that world-class software should not require world-class prices. Bangladesh has the talent. We have the products. Now we're making them available to businesses everywhere.

---

### Our Story

XiomTech was founded by **Mahamudul Hasan Miyad**, a full-stack software engineer with over 4 years of experience building production-grade web and mobile applications. After years of developing enterprise systems for clients across the UAE and Bangladesh, Miyad saw a gap in the market — businesses needed integrated software solutions that actually fit their regional needs, not expensive global platforms that required months of customization.

What started as a single POS product for a local retail client has grown into a suite of six enterprise SaaS products serving businesses across Bangladesh, the Gulf Cooperation Council, and beyond.

Today, XiomTech is led by **Mominur Rahman** (Co-founder & CEO) and Miyad (Founder & CTO), with a growing team of engineers, designers, and product specialists focused on one goal: building reliable, affordable, and powerful software that works for the businesses that need it most.

---

### By the Numbers

- **6** enterprise SaaS products in production
- **4+** years of combined development and delivery experience
- **4+** active clients across Bangladesh and the Middle East
- **99.9%** target uptime across all XiomTech products
- **3** target markets: Bangladesh, UAE, Saudi Arabia

---

### What We Build

XiomTech operates as both a **software product company** and a **custom development partner**.

On the product side, we build and maintain six flagship SaaS platforms under the Xiom brand: XiomPOS (cloud POS and ecommerce), XiomHR (HR and payroll), XiomAccounts (accounting and inventory), XiomEdu (education management), XiomTickets (customer support ticketing), and XiomCare (healthcare management). Each product is built on modern technology, priced for the real world, and continuously improved based on actual customer feedback.

On the services side, we design and build custom web applications, mobile apps, SaaS platforms, and AI-integrated systems for businesses that need tailored solutions. Our own product suite is proof of what we deliver: every Xiom product was built in-house, by our team, using the same stack and standards we apply to client work.

---

### How We Work

XiomTech follows an agile development process with continuous integration and deployment. Every product and every client project goes through the same rigorous workflow: requirements analysis, architecture design, iterative development, quality assurance testing, and post-launch support.

We work in TypeScript and JavaScript on the frontend and backend, using Next.js, React, Node.js, NestJS, and React Native for mobile. Our infrastructure runs on AWS and Vercel with PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases, designed for performance, security, and scalability from day one.

We don't use frameworks as shortcuts. We use them as foundations.

---

### Our Technology Stack

**Frontend:** Next.js 14+, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
**Backend:** Node.js, NestJS, Fastify
**Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Prisma ORM
**Mobile:** React Native (Android and iOS)
**Infrastructure:** AWS, Vercel, DigitalOcean
**Payments (Bangladesh):** bKash, Nagad, SSLCommerz
**DevOps:** Docker, CI/CD, GitHub Actions

---

### Where We Operate

XiomTech is based in **Dhaka, Bangladesh**. We serve clients across Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and internationally via remote engagement.

Our products are currently available in Bangladesh with regional versions for the GCC market under active development, including Arabic language support and ZATCA e-invoicing compliance for Saudi Arabia.

---

### Our Values

**Quality without compromise.** Every product we ship is something we would run our own business on. If it isn't good enough for us, it isn't good enough for you.

**Transparency in everything.** Our pricing is public. Our process is clear. No hidden fees, no vague timelines, no surprises.

**Built for the region.** We understand the markets we serve — the payment gateways, the compliance requirements, the languages, the bandwidth constraints. Global platforms don't. We do.

**Long-term thinking.** We are not building for an exit. We are building a software company that serves real businesses for the long term.
